# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Prerequisites:**

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager

**Core Development:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run tauri dev
# If cmake error on macOS:
CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 bun run tauri dev

# Build for production
bun run tauri build

# Frontend only development
bun run dev        # Start Vite dev server
bun run build      # Build frontend (TypeScript + Vite)
bun run preview    # Preview built frontend
```

**Model Setup (Required for Development):**

```bash
# Create models directory
mkdir -p src-tauri/resources/models

# Download required VAD model
curl -o src-tauri/resources/models/silero_vad_v4.onnx https://blob.handy.computer/silero_vad_v4.onnx
```

## Architecture Overview

Handy is a cross-platform desktop speech-to-text application built with Tauri (Rust backend + React/TypeScript frontend).

### Core Components

**Backend (Rust - src-tauri/src/):**

- `lib.rs` - Main application entry point with Tauri setup, tray menu, and managers
- `managers/` - Core business logic managers:
  - `audio.rs` - Audio recording and device management
  - `model.rs` - Whisper model downloading and management
  - `transcription.rs` - Speech-to-text processing pipeline
- `audio_toolkit/` - Low-level audio processing:
  - `audio/` - Device enumeration, recording, resampling
  - `vad/` - Voice Activity Detection using Silero VAD
- `commands/` - Tauri command handlers for frontend communication
- `shortcut.rs` - Global keyboard shortcut handling
- `settings.rs` - Application settings management

**Frontend (React/TypeScript - src/):**

- `App.tsx` - Main application component with onboarding flow
- `components/settings/` - Settings UI components
- `components/model-selector/` - Model management interface
- `hooks/` - React hooks for settings and model management
- `lib/types.ts` - Shared TypeScript type definitions

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Manager Pattern:** Core functionality is organized into managers (Audio, Model, Transcription) that are initialized at startup and managed by Tauri's state system.

**Command-Event Architecture:** Frontend communicates with backend via Tauri commands, backend sends updates via events.

**Pipeline Processing:** Audio → VAD → Whisper → Text output with configurable components at each stage.

### Technology Stack

**Core Libraries:**

- `whisper-rs` - Local Whisper inference with GPU acceleration
- `cpal` - Cross-platform audio I/O
- `vad-rs` - Voice Activity Detection
- `rdev` - Global keyboard shortcuts
- `rubato` - Audio resampling
- `rodio` - Audio playback for feedback sounds

**Platform-Specific Features:**

- macOS: Metal acceleration for Whisper, accessibility permissions
- Windows: Vulkan acceleration, code signing
- Linux: OpenBLAS + Vulkan acceleration

### Application Flow

1. **Initialization:** App starts minimized to tray, loads settings, initializes managers
2. **Model Setup:** First-run downloads preferred Whisper model (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large)
3. **Recording:** Global shortcut triggers audio recording with VAD filtering
4. **Processing:** Audio sent to Whisper model for transcription
5. **Output:** Text pasted to active application via system clipboard

### Settings System

Settings are stored using Tauri's store plugin with reactive updates:

- Keyboard shortcuts (configurable, supports push-to-talk)
- Audio devices (microphone/output selection)
- Model preferences (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large Whisper variants)
- Audio feedback and translation options

### Single Instance Architecture

The app enforces single instance behavior - launching when already running brings the settings window to front rather than creating a new process.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
